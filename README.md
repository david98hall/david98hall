## Who Am I?
Technology has been an interest of mine during my whole life and it was an easy choice for me to choose to study at Chalmers University of Technology to become a civilingenjör (Swedish degree) in Software Engineering (Informationsteknik). I taught myself to code when I was a teenager and immediately fell in love with it. After completing my Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in Data science and AI, which has been an interesting journey in itself.

By the summer of 2022, I will graduate and start working full-time as a software engineer in July.

I am a hard-working team player and I always do my best. I genuinely like what I do and find problem solving fun and rewarding. I am also a fast learner and can thus quickly adopt new technologies. I am just starting my career but I can tell it is going to be a fun ride!
