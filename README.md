## Who Am I?
Technology has been an interest of mine my entire life and it was an easy choice to choose to study at Chalmers University of Technology to become a civilingenjör (Swedish degree) in Software Engineering (Informationsteknik). I taught myself to code when I was a teenager and immediately realized it was my calling. After completing my Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in Data science and AI. I now work full-time as a software engineer in Gothenburg.
